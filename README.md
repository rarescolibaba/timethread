# TimeThread â€“ Process Time Tracker

## 1. Introduction

**Purpose:**  
TimeThread is a Windows Forms application that tracks and visualizes the time spent on various processes (apps) on your computer. It allows users to sort, filter, and analyze their app usage, helping them understand and optimize their time.

**Scope:**  
- Track running processes and time spent in each.
- Visualize usage history (hours/day for the last month).
- Filter by app categories (Games, Learning, Coding, Entertainment).
- View detailed stats for each process.
